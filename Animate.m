function Animate(t,x,P)
%Animate(t,x,P)
%
%FUNCTION:
%   Animate is used to animate a system with state x at the times in t.
%
%INPUTS:
%   t = [1xM] vector of times, Must be monotonic: t(k) < t(k+1)
%   x = [NxM] matrix of states, corresponding to times in t
%   P = animation parameter struct, with field:
%     plotFunc = @(t,x) = function handle to create a plot
%       t = a scalar time
%       x = [Nx1] state vector
%     speed = scalar multiple of time, for playback speed 
%
%OUTPUTS: 
%   Animation based on data in t and x.
